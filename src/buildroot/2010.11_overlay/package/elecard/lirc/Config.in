	help
          LIRC is a package that supports receiving and sending IR
          signals of the most common IR remote controls. It contains a
          daemon that decodes and sends IR signals, a mouse daemon
          that translates IR signals to mouse movements and a couple
          of user programs that allow to control your computer with a
          remote control.

          A list of supported hardware is available on the main page.
