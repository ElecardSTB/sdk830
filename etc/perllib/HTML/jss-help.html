<h1>Searching This Collection</h1>
<p>
Type one or several words in the search field.
The list of documents or pages that contain ALL the
words in the list will be displayed.
<p>
If a pair of words is separated by the keyword "OR",
the list of articles that contains either of the
two words will be displayed.<br>
Example: <tt>hello OR goodbye</tt>
<p>
If a word starts with "-", documents that do not
contain the word will be displayed.<br>
Example: <tt>hello -goodbye</tt><br>
will display the documents that contain "hello", but not "goodbye".
<p>
A word consists of [a-zA-Z0-9_] characters.
All words are converted to lowercase, so searching is case-insensitive.
<p>
The following are not indexed:
if you enter any of these in your search query the search is aborted
with an error message:
<ul>
<li>Numbers, including hexadecimal numbers.
<li>Words of 2 or less characters.
<li>A set of common English words that were considered not relevant.
This reduces the size of the index data files.
</ul>
<p>
The results will be sorted by relevance:
<ol>
<li>A list of files found using full word matching.
<li>A list of additional files found using partial word matching.
</ol>

<h1>About This Search Engine</h1>
<p>
This Search Engine provides basic
full-text search capability in a platform independent way.
Because it is 100% JavaScript it runs in your web browser
and requires no server-side scripts for web sites,
and no software installation.
<p>
This particular implementation is based on the
JavaScript Search Engine, by Yann LeCun &amp; Florin Nicsa
(see <a href="http://jssindex.sourceforge.net/">http://jssindex.sourceforge.net/</a>).
<br>
Modifications that were made include:
<ul>
<li>The HTML file indexer was rewritten in Perl to prevent the need for installing
the Lush package (see <a href="http://lush.sourceforge.net">http://lush.sourceforge.net/</a>).
<li>The JavaScript code was modified to work without HTML frames.
</ul>
